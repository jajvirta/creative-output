# Beliefs and cornerstones of my worldview

I keep my bookmarks and links in a non-cohesive collection. This is another
attempt to collect these ideas into one document. This is not just a link
collection, more like a collection of ideas and beliefs which then links to
the articles or documents that describe these beliefs. Yet a better way to
document these ideas would be to produce the ideas oneself (see: desirable
difficulties), but it requires a lot of work.
